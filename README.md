## Apache Spark

### Overview

Apache Spark is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing. It provides high performance for both batch and streaming data using a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution engine. 

### Resources

- [Installation Guide](docs/apache-spark-installation.md)
- [Configuration and Tuning](docs/apache-spark-configuration.md)

## InfiniBand

### Overview

InfiniBand is a high-speed, low-latency networking protocol used in HPC environments and enterprise data centers. It provides fast data transfer rates and efficient communication for large-scale systems.

### Resources

- [InfiniBand Official Website](https://www.infinibandta.org/)
